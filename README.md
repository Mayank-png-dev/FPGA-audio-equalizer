# FPGA-Based Real-Time Audio Equalizer

## Overview
Hardware-accelerated audio signal processing on FPGA implementing:
- 1024-point FFT in Verilog
- 8-band parametric EQ with adjustable gain
- Real-time processing at 48kHz sample rate

## Hardware Target
- Xilinx Artix-7 (or whatever FPGA board you have)
- WM8731 audio codec

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: FFT module implementation
- Week 3-4: Filter bank design
- Week 5-6: Hardware integration
- Week 7-8: Software interface

## Status
ðŸš§ In Progress - FFT module (Week 1)
